S10C is a performance and exhibition space for music and art located at [SET Space](https://setspace.uk/) Lewisham. The program is formed organically by a pool of artists who signup to play on the scheduled event dates. We want to focus on allowing the presentation of works in progress and spontaneous collaborations. This might mean the program isn't confirmed until relatively near to when an event will happen. Thanks in advance for your patience and curiosity!

Entry Â£5
