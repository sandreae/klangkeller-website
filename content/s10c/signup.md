VENUE + EQUIPMENT

All events happen in the project space at SET Lewisham (floor plan) (picture)

Due to noise restrictions we can't have really loud music for sustained periods, but I think most things can be acocmodated. Maybe just mention if you think this could be an issue for your performance.

The room has a *very* bright and reverberant acoustic... we're going to try and dampen it with curtains but there is only so much that can be done.

Available equipment:

- 2 x genelec studio monitors
- 1 x guitar amp
- 1 x bass amp
- 2 x SM58 mic
- 2 x XLR cable
- 1 x micro mixer
- 2 x mic stands
- some chairs
- 2 x tables

TIMINGS

The program for the night will run in the order you can see on this website (first slot first etc..). Please arrive at the venue at 18:30 so we can plan the soundchecks and evening a little together. If you need any more than 15/20mins to setup then please contact us in advance to try and arrange this.

///////////////////////

EXHIBITION INFO

There will be a wall or table available for exhibiting works. If you want to show a video get in touch so we can discus what facitilites are available. The exhibit will need to be set up in the afternoon before the event and taken down afterward so please take this into account with whatever you are planning.

///////////////////////

DOCUMENTATION

We welcome any kind of documentation (text, photo, video, audio, graphics etc..). Please ask permission from the artists if you will be making live recordings. Put your name down on the signup form if you are planning to do this.

///////////////////////

BAR/DOOR STAFF

Please sign-up to help out on the bar and door if you are free/attending anyway, we'll show you what to do if you've not done it before.

///////////////////////

MONEY

All performers, staff and documentarians split all profits. It might not be a lot of money :-( but we will share everything fairly.
